# Tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6
Hi there, fellow CSE 15L students! I am going to show you how to Installing VScode, Remotely Connecting, and Trying Some Commands on the computer.
1. Download VScode in this url (https://code.visualstudio.com/). Please make sure that you select the right version (i.e. windows version for windows users).
2. Open the installer, and click install.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118026674/212520152-5529a277-2011-4efd-9a50-1db2c7a1a73b.png)
3. Download Git in this url (https://gitforwindows.org/). Once downloaded, learn how to use git in VScode in this url (https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994).
4. Open the terminal, and type in "ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu", where you replace zz with your own id. To find your id, go to this url (https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
5. Then, it will request your password. Type in your password. The password won't show due to security reason. It is normal. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118026674/212520307-39d63693-2353-4db0-87c8-e24970c5ba9a.png)
6. And you are logged in! Now, you can try some commands on the remote computer. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118026674/212520364-72c4e3ab-1e2d-427e-8975-ef529ab32d9e.png)
